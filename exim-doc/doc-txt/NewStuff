New Features in Exim
--------------------

This file contains descriptions of new features that have been added to Exim,
but have not yet made it into the main manual (which is most conveniently
updated when there is a relatively large batch of changes). The doc/ChangeLog
file contains a listing of all changes, including bug fixes.

Version 4.61
------------

PH/01 There is a new global option called disable_ipv6, which does exactly what
      its name implies. If set true, even if the Exim binary has IPv6 support,
      no IPv6 activities take place. AAAA records are never looked up for host
      names given in manual routing data or elsewhere. AAAA records that are
      received from the DNS as additional data for MX records are ignored. Any
      IPv6 addresses that are listed in local_interfaces, manualroute route
      data, etc. are also ignored. If IP literals are enabled, the ipliteral
      router declines to handle IPv6 literal addresses.

PH/02 There are now 20 of each type of ACL variable by default (instead of 10).
      It is also possible to change the numbers by setting ACL_CVARS and/or
      ACL_MVARS in Local/Makefile. Backward compatibility is maintained if you
      upgrade to this release with existing messages containing ACL variable
      settings on the queue. However, going in the other direction
      (downgrading) will not be compatible; the values of ACL variables will be
      lost.

PH/03 If quota_warn_message contains a From: header, Exim now refrains from
      adding the default one. Similarly, if it contains a Reply-To: header, the
      errors_reply_to option, if set, is not used.

PH/04 The variables $auth1, $auth2, $auth3 are now available in authenticators,
      containing the same values as $1, $2, $3. The new variables are provided
      because the numerical variables can be reset during string expansions
      (for example, during a "match" operation) and so may lose the
      authentication data. The preferred variables are now the new ones, with
      the use of the numerical ones being deprecated, though the support will
      not be removed, at least, not for a long time.

PH/05 The "control=freeze" ACL modifier can now be followed by /no_tell. If
      the global option freeze_tell is set, it is ignored for the current
      message (that is, nobody is told about the freezing), provided all the
      "control=freeze" modifiers that are obeyed in the current message have
      the /no_tell option.

PH/06 In both GnuTLS and OpenSSL, an expansion of tls_privatekey that results
      in an empty string is now treated as unset.

PH/07 There is a new log selector called sender_verify_fail, which is set by
      default. If it is unset, the separate log line that gives details of a
      sender verification failure is not written. Log lines for the rejection
      of SMTP commands (e.g. RCPT) contain just "sender verify failed", so some
      detail is lost.

PH/08 The default for dns_check_names_pattern now allows slashes within names,
      as there are now some PTR records that contain slashes. This check is
      only to protect against broken name servers that fall over on strange
      characters, so the fact that it applies to all lookups doesn't matter.

PH/09 The default for rfc4131_query_timeout has been changed from 30s to 5s.

PH/10 When compiled on FreeBSD, NetBSD, or BSD/OS, the pipe transport has a new
      Boolean option called use_classresources, defaulting false. If it is set
      true, the setclassresources() function is used to set resource limits
      when a pipe transport is run to perform a delivery. The limits for the
      uid under which the pipe is to run are obtained from the login class
      database.

PH/11 If retry_interval_max is set greater than 24 hours, it is quietly reset
      to 24 hours. This avoids potential overflow problems when processing G
      and H retry rules, and it seems reasonable to require a retry at least
      once a day.

PH/12 When the plaintext authenticator is running as a client, the server
      challenges are now checked to ensure they are valid base64 strings. The
      default action on failure is to abort the authentication. However, if
      client_ignore_invalid_base64 is set true, invalid responses are ignored.

PH/13 When the plaintext authenticator is running as a client, the challenges
      from the server are placed in $auth1, $auth2, etc. as they are received.
      Thus, the challege that is received in response to sending the first
      string (with the AUTH command) can be used in the expansion of the second
      string, and so on. Currently, up to 3 challenge strings are available in
      this way. If an invalid base64 string is received when client_ignore_
      invalid_base64 is set, an empty string is put in the $auth<n> variable.

PH/14 Messages created by the autoreply transport now contain a References:
      header. This is constructed in accordance with rules that are described
      in section 3.64 of RFC 2822, which states that replies should contain
      such a header line, and section 3.14 of RFC 3834, which states that
      automatic responses are not different in this respect. However, because
      some mail processing software does not cope well with very long header
      lines, no more than 12 message IDs are copied from the References: header
      line in the incoming message. If there are more than 12, the first one
      and then the final 11 are copied, before adding the message ID of the
      incoming message.

PH/15 The smtp transport has a new option called authenticated_sender_force.
      When set true, it allows the authenticated_sender option's value to be
      used, even if Exim has not authenticated as a client.

PH/16 The expansion ${time_eval:<string>} converts an Exim time string such as
      2d4h1m into a number of seconds.

PH/17 The ACL modifier control=allow_auth_unadvertised can be used to permit a
      client host to use the SMTP AUTH command even when it has not been
      advertised in response to EHLO. Furthermore, because there are apparently
      some really broken clients that do this, Exim will even accept AUTH after
      HELO when this control is set. It should only be used if you really need
      it, and you should limit its use to those broken hosts that do not work
      without it. For example:

        warn hosts   = 192.168.34.25
             control = allow_auth_unadvertised

      This control is permitted only in the connection and HELO ACLs.

PH/18 There is a new ACL modifier called "add_header" which does what its name
      implies. It specifies one of more header lines that are to be added to an
      incoming message, assuming, of course, that the message is ultimately
      accepted.

      This modifier is permitted in the MAIL, RCPT, PREDATA, DATA, MIME, and
      non-SMTP ACLs (in other words, those that are concerned with accepting a
      message). Added header lines are accumulated during the MAIL, RCPT, and
      PREDATA ACLs, with any duplicates being discarded. They are then added to
      the message before processing the DATA and MIME ACLs, during which
      further added header lines are accumulated, again with duplicates
      discarded. Thus, it is possible to add two identical header lines to an
      SMTP message, but only if one is added before DATA and one after.

      In the case of non-SMTP messages, new headers are accumulated during the
      non-SMTP ACL, and added to the message at the end.

      The add_header modifier is available for use with all ACL verbs. In the
      case of the WARN verb, add_header supersedes the use of "message" for
      this purpose; for the other verbs, it provides a new facility. If both
      add_header and "message" are present on a WARN verb, both are processed
      according to their specifications.

      The add_header modifier acts immediately it is encountered during the
      processing of an ACL. This is different to the (now-deprecated) use of
      "message" on a WARN verb, where the action is taken only if all the
      conditions are true. Notice the difference between these two cases on a
      RCPT ACL:

         deny add_header = ADDED: some text
              <some condition>

         deny <some condition>
              add_header = ADDED: some text

      In the first case, the header is always added, whether or not the current
      recipient is rejected. In the second case, the header is added only if
      the recipient is rejected.

      If add_header appears more than once on an ACL statement, multiple
      headers are added, provided that they have different content. (In the
      case of WARN with "message", only the last value of "message" is used.)

      The facility for specifying where the new header is to be inserted, as
      described for WARN with "message" in section 39.19 of the 4.60 manual, is
      supported.

PH/19 The following errors can now be detected in retry rules:

      mail_4xx   This is like rcpt_4xx, but applies to MAIL commands

      data_4xx   This is like rcpt_4xx, but applies to DATA commands and the
                 response code after the end of the data

      lost_connection  This error occurs when the server unexpectedly closes
                 the SMTP connection. There may, of course, legitmate reasons
                 for this (host died, network died), but if it repeats a lot
                 for the same host, it indicates something odd.

      tls_required  The server was required to use TLS (hosts_require_tls),
                 but either did not offer it, or responded with 4xx to
                 STARTTLS, or there was a problem setting up the TLS connection

      Note that a 5xx response to STARTTLS is a permanent error.
