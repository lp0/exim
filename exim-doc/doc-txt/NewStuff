New Features in Exim
--------------------

This file contains descriptions of new features that have been added to Exim,
but have not yet made it into the main manual (which is most conveniently
updated when there is a relatively large batch of changes). The doc/ChangeLog
file contains a listing of all changes, including bug fixes.

Version 4.61
------------

PH/01 There is a new global option called disable_ipv6, which does exactly what
      its name implies. If set true, even if the Exim binary has IPv6 support,
      no IPv6 activities take place. AAAA records are never looked up for host
      names given in manual routing data or elsewhere. AAAA records that are
      received from the DNS as additional data for MX records are ignored. Any
      IPv6 addresses that are listed in local_interfaces, manualroute route
      data, etc. are also ignored. If IP literals are enabled, the ipliteral
      router declines to handle IPv6 literal addresses.


Version 4.60
------------

The documentation is up-to-date for the 4.60 release. Major new features since
the 4.50 release are:

. Support for SQLite.

. Support for IGNOREQUOTA in LMTP.

. Extensions to the "submission mode" features.

. Support for Client SMTP Authorization (CSA).

. Support for ratelimiting hosts and users.

. New expansion items to help with the BATV "prvs" scheme.

. A "match_ip" condition, that matches an IP address against a list.

There are many more minor changes.
