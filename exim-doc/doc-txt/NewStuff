New Features in Exim
--------------------

This file contains descriptions of new features that have been added to Exim,
but have not yet made it into the main manual (which is most conveniently
updated when there is a relatively large batch of changes). The doc/ChangeLog
file contains a listing of all changes, including bug fixes.

Version 4.61
------------

PH/01 There is a new global option called disable_ipv6, which does exactly what
      its name implies. If set true, even if the Exim binary has IPv6 support,
      no IPv6 activities take place. AAAA records are never looked up for host
      names given in manual routing data or elsewhere. AAAA records that are
      received from the DNS as additional data for MX records are ignored. Any
      IPv6 addresses that are listed in local_interfaces, manualroute route
      data, etc. are also ignored. If IP literals are enabled, the ipliteral
      router declines to handle IPv6 literal addresses.

PH/02 There are now 20 of each type of ACL variable by default (instead of 10).
      It is also possible to change the numbers by setting ACL_CVARS and/or
      ACL_MVARS in Local/Makefile. Backward compatibility is maintained if you
      upgrade to this release with existing messages containing ACL variable
      settings on the queue. However, going in the other direction
      (downgrading) will not be compatible; the values of ACL variables will be
      lost.

PH/03 If quota_warn_message contains a From: header, Exim now refrains from
      adding the default one. Similarly, if it contains a Reply-To: header, the
      errors_reply_to option, if set, is not used.

PH/04 The variables $auth1, $auth2, $auth3 are now available in authenticators,
      containing the same values as $1, $2, $3. The new variables are provided
      because the numerical variables can be reset during string expansions
      (for example, during a "match" operation) and so may lose the
      authentication data. The preferred variables are now the new ones, with
      the use of the numerical ones being deprecated, though the support will
      not be removed, at least, not for a long time.

PH/05 The "control=freeze" ACL modifier can now be followed by /no_tell. If
      the global option freeze_tell is set, it is ignored for the current
      message (that is, nobody is told about the freezing), provided all the
      "control=freeze" modifiers that are obeyed in the current message have
      the /no_tell option.

PH/06 In both GnuTLS and OpenSSL, an expansion of tls_privatekey that results
      in an empty string is now treated as unset.

PH/07 There is a new log selector called sender_verify_fail, which is set by
      default. If it is unset, the separate log line that gives details of a
      sender verification failure is not written. Log lines for the rejection
      of SMTP commands (e.g. RCPT) contain just "sender verify failed", so some
      detail is lost.

PH/08 The default for dns_check_names_pattern now allows slashes within names,
      as there are now some PTR records that contain slashes. This check is
      only to protect against broken name servers that fall over on strange
      characters, so the fact that it applies to all lookups doesn't matter.



Version 4.60
------------

The documentation is up-to-date for the 4.60 release. Major new features since
the 4.50 release are:

. Support for SQLite.

. Support for IGNOREQUOTA in LMTP.

. Extensions to the "submission mode" features.

. Support for Client SMTP Authorization (CSA).

. Support for ratelimiting hosts and users.

. New expansion items to help with the BATV "prvs" scheme.

. A "match_ip" condition, that matches an IP address against a list.

There are many more minor changes.
